Welcome to my small garden patch of the interweb. Here you can find few things about me and the things that I like to think about.  


### About

Most of my time is spent thinking about cello and combinatorics in some capacity or another. I am currently a graduate student in music theory at McGill University studying rhythmic canons and preparing for various orchestral audtions. In the future, I aspire to become a professional cellist and to study and share my love of combinatorics. On this site you can find some recordings and videos of me playing cello as well as some of my writings related to combinatorics.
